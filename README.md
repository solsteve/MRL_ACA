## Modern Reinforcement Learning: Actor Critic Algorithms

This was an advanced course on **deep reinforcement learning**, taught by [Phil Tabor at UDemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/actor-critic-methods-from-paper-to-code-with-pytorch/), it showed how to implement **policy gradient, actor critic, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), and soft actor critic (SAC) algorithms** in a variety of challenging environments from the Open AI gym. There was a strong focus on dealing with environments with **continuous action spaces**.
